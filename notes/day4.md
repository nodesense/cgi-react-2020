### useReducer

    We already have state (useState)
            getter and setter pattern
            the logic should be written with in React component

    then why we need reducers?

    useReducer - helps to maintain the state within functional component
            extention, where logics are seperated from UI
             called as reducers
            complex state management
            dispatch() this call the reducers
